# Graph Theory
A graph is an ordered pair G = (V,E) consisting of a nonempty set V (called the vertices) and a set E (called the edges) of two-element subsets of V.

# Prim's Algorithim

Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithim is a Greedy Algorithim that determines the lowest total-cost spanning tree of an existing graph. It begins with an empty spanning tree and is intilized by a random vertex from the existing graph G. This algorithim maintains two sets of vertices to satisfy the MST; one set is a list of vertices that are included in the MST, and the other set is the availble vertices to add within the neighborhood of the tree. Through each iteration, the algorithim chooses the edge set with the lowest cost (the lowest weight) and adds that vertex to the tree. The program terminates once the set of nodes in the tree is equal to the set of nodes in the original graph.

# Instructions to Execute

This program is simple to use and, as stated above, can be run on any Operating System without changing file paths. 
Begin by executing the script called "uhd_weighted_graphs.py" and follow the instructions as prompted in the console.

You have 3 graphs to chooose from:   
-G1  
-G2  
-G3
